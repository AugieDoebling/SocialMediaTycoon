1. As a user, I want to be able to see how big of a following other people have, so I can gauge how well I am doing in the game. 
2. As a developer, I want to have old versions of code saved, so that if accidentally delete code I can easily retrieve it. 
3. As a marketer, I want to have nice graphics and logo, so the game will appeal to more users.
